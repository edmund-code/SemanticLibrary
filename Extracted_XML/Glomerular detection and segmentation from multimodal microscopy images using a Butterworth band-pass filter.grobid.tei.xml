<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a rapid, scalable, and high throughput computational pipeline to accurately detect and segment the glomerulus from renal histopathology images with high precision and accuracy. Our proposed method integrates information from fluorescence and bright-field microscopy imaging of renal tissues. For computation, we exploit the simplicity, yet extreme robustness of Butterworth bandpass filter to extract the glomeruli by utilizing the information inherent in the renal tissue stained with immunofluorescence marker sensitive at blue emission wavelength as well as tissue auto-fluorescence. The resulting output is in-turn used to detect and segment multiple glomeruli within the fieldof-view in the same tissue section post-stained with histopathological stains. Our approach, optimized over 40 images, produced a sensitivity/specificity of 0.95/0.84 on n = 66 test images, each containing one or more glomeruli. The work not only has implications in renal histopathology involving diseases with glomerular structural damages, which is vital to track the progression of the disease, but also aids in the development of a tool to rapidly generate a database of glomeruli from whole slide images, essential for training neural networks. The current practice to detect glomerular structural damage is by the manual examination of biopsied renal tissues, which is laborious, time intensive and tedious. Existing automated pipelines employ complex neural networks which are computationally extensive, demand expensive highperformance hardware and require large expert-annotated datasets for training. Our automated method to detect glomerular boundary will aid in rapid extraction of glomerular compartmental features from large renal histopathological images.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The glomerulus, a tuft of capillaries located within the Bowman's capsule, is the basic filtration unit of the kidney <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . Disruptions in the glomerular structure affects the glomerular filtration barrier, the latter of which is responsible for the filtration of blood into urine. This disruption results in proteinuria, a condition characterized by the presence of excessive proteins in the urine, a common indicator of several renal diseases. Hence, the histological damages within the glomeruli are primarily analyzed by experts while evaluating a renal biopsy, to identify kidney diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . Moreover, various compartments within the glomeruli, such as the mesangial matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , capillary walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> , and podocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> , are the focus of several studies to comprehend the changes within the kidney during different disease stages. However, to detect these compartments, it is vital to first identify the glomerular boundaries within the whole slide image (WSI) rapidly with high accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</p><p>Automated glomerular segmentation remains a challenge today due to its complex nature and intense variations in size and shape within the renal section <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . Although consistent under normal conditions in vivo, the glomerulus undergoes swelling during hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> , hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> , and diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> . Furthermore, the manual tissue sectioning causes variations in the sizes of the glomerulus, owing to the variations in sectioning angles. Apart from this, the variations in staining intensities further complicates the task. These inconsistent geometrical parameters make it inconvenient to develop a single robust algorithm capable of detecting and segmenting all the glomeruli within a tissue section.

The latter also fails to detect more than one glomerulus within an image. Other automated techniques employ complex neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , which utilize expensive dedicated hardware and require a large expert-annotated dataset of training images.</p><p>We have developed a rapid, high throughput, scalable, and robust computational pipeline, capable of detecting and segmenting multiple glomeruli within the field-of-view, using minimal computational complexity, by integrating the two different microscopic imaging modalities of immunofluorescence and histology. Our pipeline utilizes the robust yet simple Butterworth band-pass filter to exploit previously unexplored innate features of fluorescence photo physical properties of DAPI generated and tissue autofluorescence signals, thereby reducing the computational cost and complexity when compared to other techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> , while generating comparable performance.</p><p>The developed method could thereby aid in renal disease diagnosis and tracking of disease progression and therapeutic response by alleviating the burden of manual detection of glomeruli within the tissue. It would also aid in the development of a tool, capable of rapidly generating glomerular databases by detecting and segmenting them from whole slide renal tissue images, which are crucial for training neural networks. Furthermore, it could also be used to extract various compartments within the glomerulus, such as the mesangium, the podocytes and the capillary walls which are the focus of several studies. filtering of the image in Fig. 1D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">METHODOLOGY 2.1 Schematic overview</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the proposed computational pipeline to segment glomerular boundaries. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> shows the whole slide image of a mouse renal tissue section stained with immunofluorescence (IF) markers. The cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (ex/em (nm): 358/461) and tissue auto-fluorescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was captured at 488 nm excitation and 525 nm emission. In this carefully designed imaging set-up, glomerular regions are demarcated by significantly lower auto-fluorescent signal than surrounding tubular regions. This is a direct result of the high numbers of mitochondria found in the cytoplasm and in the basal infoldings of tubular epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , which contain autofluorescent molecules such as NADH/NADPH and and FADH2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . Glomerular residents such as mesangial, endothelial or podocyte cells are not hallmarked by abundant mitochondria, thereby providing a huge distinction in their intensities. This inherent biological difference within the glomerulus and the surrounding tubules is exploited using a Butterworth band-pass filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to extract solely the regions containing glomeruli from the fluorescent tissue image, see Section 2.4. The same renal tissue was poststained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>. The two whole slide images obtained from two distinct microscopic imaging modalities are then registered by matching their speeded up robust features (SURF) features <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). Random image patches are selected from the registered IF image, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref> and are filtered using the Butterworth band-pass filter to detect and segment the glomeruli. The resulting mask indicating the glomerular region is shown in binary in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1G</ref> shows the PAS image patch of glomerulus corresponding to that shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>. The mask depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref> is overlaid with the PAS image patch, to highlight the glomerular boundary in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1H</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tissue slicing and image acquisition</head><p>Tissue sample of normal C57BL/6J background mice were used. All animal studies were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University at Buffalo Animal Studies Committee. Tissue slices of 2 µm were stained using immunofluorescence markers, and subsequently imaged using a whole-slide imaging fluorescence microscope (Aperio Versa, Leica, Buffalo Grove, Il). For immunofluorescence imaging, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (ex/em (nm): 358/461) and tissue auto-fluorescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> was captured at 488 nm excitation and 525 nm emission. The tissue section was post-stained using Periodic acid-Schiff, and imaged in brightfield using the Aperio scanner. Pixel resolution for fluorescence imaging was 0.16 µm and for brightfield imaging was 0.13 µm. Other details of tissue preparation, staining, and optics configuration used for imaging were remain same as discussed in our earlier works <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . The computational method proposed here has been constructed around this imaging configuration, and the parameter values may change proportionally for other imaging conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Image registration</head><p>DAPI (pseudo-blue) channel image was extracted and processed to generate a binary image indicating the location of nuclei in the registered immunofluorescence image. Similarly, the color deconvolution algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> was used to extract the nuclei locations within the PAS image. These binary images were then registered by matching their SURF features <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> . This registration enabled the extraction of various image patches from the IF whole slide image and their corresponding PAS stained counterparts.</p></div>

The transfer functions of the low pass and high pass filter (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>), respectively) used to design the Butterworth band-pass filter (Eq.

The band of frequencies thus selected were</p><p>2.5 L D = and 300 H D =</p><p>, which accurately detects the glomerular region while rejecting the surrounding tubular region and interstitial spaces. The obtained mask (see, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>) was overlayed with the corresponding PAS image section (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1G</ref>). Our proposed pipeline is able to detect glomerular boundaries, including multiple glomeruli within the same image, with a mean sensitivity/specificity 0.95/0.84 over n = 66 images, each containing one or more glomeruli. Ground-truth glomerular boundaries were obtained manually. The above performance was obtained by optimizing the cut-off frequencies of the proposed band-pass filter. The performance of glomerular segmentation in each of the images from a total of n = 66 images are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>The proposed pipeline can be used to rapidly generate a database of glomeruli, extracted from whole slide images, essential for training neural networks. We have shown for the first time a rapid, high throughput, scalable, and robust computational pipeline, integrating two different microscopy image modalities to detect and segment multiple glomeruli within the field-of-view in renal histopathology. Our pipeline builds upon exploiting, for the first time, previously unexplored innate features of fluorescence photo-physical properties of DAPI generated and tissue autofluorescence signals. We are currently studying the performance of the proposed method in diverse murine and human renal histopathology conditions, result of which will be published in a future journal publication.</p><p>Several possible applications of the proposed method can be considered. In the future, we plan to extend the study by including images of structurally damaged glomeruli by diseases like diabetic nephropathy for analysis. We wish to eventually modify the pipeline into an automated whole-slide glomerular segmentation algorithm, which can be easily translated to clinics for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Moreover, the glomerular segmentation could further aid in calculating the cell density per glomerulus, which is often used as a diagnostic tool for renal diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSION</head><p>This study shows for the first time that the inherent properties of immunofluorescence staining of renal tissues can be used for automated glomeruli detection within histopathological images. Automated detection and segmentation of glomerular boundaries can help establish pipelines that further detect individual components within the glomerulus from whole-slide images. The resulting feature distributions would enable studying glomerular disease progression in an unbiased and quantitative fashion.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
