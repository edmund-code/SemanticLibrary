<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Accurate segmentation of tubular, network-like structures, such as vessels, neurons, or roads, is relevant to many fields of research. For such structures, the topology is their most important characteristic; particularly preserving connectedness: in the case of vascular networks, missing a connected vessel entirely alters the blood-flow dynamics. We introduce a novel similarity measure termed center-lineDice (short clDice), which is calculated on the intersection of the segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleta. We theoretically prove that clDice guarantees topology preservation up to homotopy equivalence for binary 2D and 3D segmentation. Extending this, we propose a computationally efficient, differentiable loss function (soft-clDice) for training arbitrary neural segmentation networks. We benchmark the soft-clDice loss on five public datasets, including vessels, roads and neurons (2D  and 3D). Training on soft-clDice leads to segmentation with more accurate connectivity information, higher graph similarity, and better volumetric scores.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Segmentation of tubular and curvilinear structures is an essential problem in numerous domains, such as clinical and biological applications (blood vessel and neuron segmentation from microscopic, optoacoustic, or radiology images), remote sensing applications (road network segmentation from satellite images) and industrial quality control, etc. In the aforementioned domains, a topologically accurate segmentation is necessary to guarantee error-free downstream tasks, such as computational hemodynamics, route planning, Alzheimer's disease prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, or stroke modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. When optimizing computational algorithms for segmenting curvilinear structures, the two most commonly used categories of quantitative performance measures for evaluating segmentation accuracy of tubular struc-* The authors contributed equally to the work Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Motivation: The figure shows a 3D rendering of a complex, whole brain vascular dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, where an exemplary 2D slice of the data is chosen and segmented by two different models, see purple (middle) and red (right), respectively. The two segmentation results achieve identical quality in terms of the traditional Dice score. Note that the purple segmentation does not capture the small vessels while segmenting the large vessel very accurately; on the other side, the red segmentation captures all vessels in the image while being less accurate on the radius of the large vessel. Skeleta are drawn in yellow. From a topology or network perspective, the red segmentation is evidently preferred. tures, are 1) overlap based measures such as Dice, precision, recall, and Jaccard index; and 2) volumetric distance measures such as the Hausdorff and Mahalanobis distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</p><p>However, in most segmentation problems, where the object of interest is 1) locally a tubular structure and 2) globally forms a network, the most important characteristic is the connectivity of the global network topology. Note that network in this context implies a physically connected structure, such as a vessel network, a road network, etc., which is also the primary structure of interest for the given image data. As an example, one can refer to brain vasculature analysis, where a missed vessel segment in the segmentation mask can pathologically be interpreted as a stroke or may lead to dramatic changes in a global simulation of blood flow. On the other hand, limited over-or undersegmentation of vessel radius can be tolerated, because it does not affect clinical diagnosis.</p><p>For evaluating segmentations in such tubular-network structures, traditional volume-based performance indices are sub-optimal. For example, Dice and Jaccard rely on the average voxel-wise hit or miss prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. In a task like network-topology extraction, a spatially contiguous sequence of correct voxel prediction is more meaningful than a spurious correct prediction. This ambiguity is relevant for objects of interest, which are of the same thickness as the resolution of the signal. For them, it is evident that a singlevoxel shift in the prediction can change the topology of the whole network. Further, a globally averaged metric does not equally weight tubular-structures with large, medium, and small radii (cf. <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>. In real vessel datasets, where vessels of wide radius ranges exist, e.g. 30 µm for arterioles and 5 µm for capillaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, training on a globally averaged loss induces a strong bias towards the volumetric segmentation of large vessels. Both scenarios are pronounced in imaging modalities, such as fluorescence microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref> and optoacoustics, which focus on mapping small capillary structures.</p><p>To this end, we are interested in a topology-aware image segmentation, eventually enabling a correct network extraction. Therefore, we ask the following research questions: Q1. What is a good pixelwise measure to benchmark segmentation algorithms for tubular, and related linear and curvilinear structure segmentation while guaranteeing the preservation of the network-topology?</p><p>Q2. Can we use this improved measure as a loss function for neural networks, which is a void in existing literature?</p></div>

Another approach enables the predefinition of Betti numbers and enforces them on the training <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The aforementioned literature has advanced the communities understanding of topology-preservation, but critically, they do not possess end-to-end loss functions that optimize topology-preservation. In this context, the literature remains sparse. Recently, Mosinska et al. suggested that pixel-wise loss-functions are unsuitable and used selected filter responses from a VGG19 network as an additional penalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Nonetheless, their approach does not prove topology preservation. Importantly, Hu et al. proposed the first continuous-valued loss function based on the Betti number and persistent homology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. However, this method is based on matching critical points, which, according to the authors makes the training very expensive and error-prone for real image-sized patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. While this is already limiting for a translation to large real world data set, we find that none of these approaches have been extended to three dimensional (3D) data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Our Contributions</head><p>The objective of this paper is to identify an efficient, general, and intuitive loss function that enables topology preservation while segmenting tubular objects. We introduce a novel connectivity-aware similarity measure named clDice for benchmarking tubular-segmentation algorithms. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees for the topological correctness of the clDice for binary 2D and 3D segmentation. As a consequence of its formulation based on morphological skeletons, our measure pronounces the network's topology instead of equally weighting every voxel. Using a differentiable soft-skeletonization, we show that the clDice measure can be used to train neural networks. We show experimental results for various 2D and 3D network segmentation tasks to demonstrate the practical applicability of our proposed similarity measure and loss function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Let's Emphasize Connectivity</head><p>We propose a novel connectivity-preserving metric to evaluate tubular and linear structure segmentation based on intersecting skeletons with masks. We call this metric cen-terlineDice or clDice. We consider two binary masks: the ground truth mask (V L ) and the predicted segmentation masks (V P ). First, the skeletons S P and S L are extracted from V P and V L respectively. Subsequently, we compute the fraction of S P that lies within V L , which we call Topology Precision or Tprec(S P ,V L ), and vice-a-versa we obtain Topology Sensitivity or Tsens(S L ,V P ) as defined bellow;</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Tprec(S P ,V L )= |S P \ V L | |S P | ;T s e n s ( S L ,V P )= |S L \ V P | |S L |<label>(1)</label></formula><p>We observe that the measure Tprec(S P ,V L ) is susceptible to false positives in the prediction while the measure Tsens(S L ,V P ) is susceptible to false negatives. This explains our rationale behind referring to the Tprec(S P ,V L ) as topology's precision and to the Tsens(S L ,V P ) as its sensitivity. Since we want to maximize both precision and sensitivity (recall), we define clDice to be the harmonic mean (also known as F1 or Dice) of both the measures:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">clDice(V P ,V L )=2⇥ Tprec(S P ,V L ) ⇥ Tsens(S L ,V P ) Tprec(S P ,V L )+Tsens(S L ,V P )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Note that our clDice formulation is not defined for Tprec = 0 and Tsens = 0, but can easily be extended continuously with the value 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Topological Guarantees for clDice</head><p>The following section provides general theoretical guarantees for the preservation of topological properties achieved by optimizing clDice under mild conditions on the input. Roughly, these conditions state that the object of interest is embedded in S 3 in a non-knotted way, as is typically the case for blood vessel and road structures. Specifically, we assume that both ground truth and prediction admit foreground and background skeleta, which means that both foreground and background are homotopyequivalent to topological graphs, which we assume to be embedded as skeleta. Here, the voxel grid is considered as a cubical complex, consisting of elementary cubes of dimensions 0, 1, 2, and 3. This is a special case of a cell complex (specifically, a CW complex), which is a space constructed inductively, starting with isolated points (0-cells), and gluing a collection of topological balls of dimension k (called k-cells) along their boundary spheres to a k 1dimensional complex. The voxel grid, seen as a cell complex in this sense, can be completed to an ambient complex that is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere S 3 by attaching a single exterior cell to the boundary. In order to consider foreground and background of a binary image as complementary subspaces, the foreground is now assumed to be the union of closed unit cubes in the voxel grid, corresponding to voxels with value 1; and the background is the complement in the ambient complex. This convention is commonly used in digital topology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. The assumption on the background can then be replaced by a convenient equivalent condition, stating that the foreground is also homotopy equivalent to a subcomplex obtained from the ambient complex by only removing 3-cells and 2-cells. Such a subcomplex is then clearly homotopy-equivalent to the complement of a 1-complex.</p><p>We will now observe that the above assumptions imply that the foreground and the background are connected and have a free fundamental group and vanishing higher fundamental groups. In particular, the homotopy type is already determined by the first Betti number<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> ; moreover, a map inducing an isomorphism in homology is already a homotopy equivalence. To see this, first note that both foreground and background are assumed to have the homology of a graph, in particular, homology is trivial in degree 2. By Alexander duality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, then, both foreground and background have trivial reduced cohomology in degree 0, meaning that they are connected. This implies that both have a free fundamental group (as any connected graph) and vanishing higher homotopy groups. In particular, since homology in degree 1 is the Abelianization of the fundamental group, these two groups are isomorphic. This in turn implies that in our setting a map that induces isomorphisms in homology already induces isomorphisms between all homotopy groups. By Whitehead's theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, such a map is then a homotopy equivalence.</p><p>The following theorem shows that under our assumptions on the images admitting foreground and background skeleta, the existence of certain nested inclusions already implies the homotopy-equivalence of foreground and background, which we refer to as topology preservation.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Theorem 1. Let L A ✓ A ✓ K A and L B ✓ B ✓ K B</formula><p>be connected subcomplexes of some cell complex. Assume that the above inclusions are homotopy equivalences. If the subcomplexes also are related by inclusions L A ✓ B ✓ K A and L B ✓ A ✓ K B , then these inclusions must be homotopy equivalences as well. In particular, A and B are homotopy-equivalent.</p><p>Proof. An inclusion of cell complexes map is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. Since the inclusion L A ✓ B ✓ K A induces an isomorphism, the inclusion L A ✓ B induces a left-inverse, and since B ✓ K B induces an isomorphism, the inclusion L A ✓ K B also induces a left-inverse. At the same time, since the inclusion L B ✓ A ✓ K B induces an isomorphism, the inclusion A ✓ K B induces a left-inverse, and since L A ✓ A induces an isomorphism, the inclusion L A ✓ K B also induces a right-inverse. Together, this implies that the inclusion L A ✓ K B induces an isomorphism.</p><p>Together with the isomorphisms induced by L A ✓ A and B ✓ K B , we obtain isomorphisms induced by L A ✓ B and by A ✓ K B , which compose to an isomorphism between the homotopy groups of A and B.</p><p>Corollary 1.1. Let V L and V P be two binary masks admitting foreground and background skeleta, such that the foreground skeleton of V L is included in the foreground of V P and vice versa, and similarly for the background. Then the foregrounds of V L and V P are homotopy equivalent, and the same is true for their backgrounds.</p><p>Note that the inclusion condition in this corollary is satisfied if and only if clDice evaluates to 1 on both foreground and background of (V L ,V P ).</p><p>This proof lays the ground for a general interpretation of clDice as a topology preserving metric. Additionally, we provide an elaborate explanation of clDice topological properties, using concepts of applied digital topology in the theory section of the Supplementary material <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Training Neural Networks with clDice</head><p>In the previous section we provided general theoretic guarantees how clDice has topology preserving properties. The following chapter shows how we applied our theory to efficiently train topology preserving networks using the clDice formulation. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref><ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">2</ref>4.1. Soft-clDice using Soft-skeletonization:</p><p>Extracting accurate skeletons is essential to our method. For this task, a multitude of approaches has been proposed. However, most of them are not fully differentiable and therefore unsuited to be used in a loss function. Popular approaches use the Euclidean distance transform or utilize repeated morphological thinning. Euclidean distance transform has been used on multiple occasions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, but remains a discrete operation and, to the best of our knowledge, an end-to-end differentiable approximation remains to be developed, preventing the use in a loss function for training neural networks. On the contrary, morphological thinning is a sequence of dilation and erosion operations [c.f. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>].</p><p>Importantly, thinning using morphological operations (skeletonization) on curvilinear structures can be topologypreserving <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Min-and max filters are commonly used as the grey-scale alternative of morphological dilation and erosion. Motivated by this, we propose 'soft-skeletonization', where an iterative min-and max-pooling is applied as a proxy for morphological erosion and dilation. The Algorithm 1 describes the iterative processes involved in its computation. The hyper-parameter k involved in its computation represents the iterations and has to be greater than or equal to the maximum observed radius. In our experiments, this parameter depends on the dataset. For example, it is k =5...25 in our experiments, matching the pixel radius of the largest observed tubular structures. Choosing a larger k does not reduce performance but increases computation Algorithm 1: soft-skeleton Input: I,k I 0 maxpool(minpool(I)) S ReLU(I I 0 ) for i 0 to k do I minpool(I) I 0 maxpool(minpool(I)) S S +(1 S) ReLU(I I 0 ) end Output: S Algorithm 2: soft-clDice Input: V P ,V L S P soft-skeleton(V P ) S L soft-skeleton(V L ) Tprec(S P ,V L ) |SP VL|+✏ |SP |+✏ Tsens(S L ,V P ) |SL VP |+✏ |SL|+✏ clDice 2 ⇥ Tprec(SP ,VL)⇥Tsens(SL,VP ) Tprec(SP ,VL)+Tsens(SL,VP ) Output: clDice time. On the other hand, a too low k leads to incomplete skeletonization.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the successive steps of our skeletonization are intuitively represented. In the early iterations, the structures with a small radius are skeletonized and preserved until the later iterations when the thicker structures become skeletonized. This enables the extraction of a parameter-free, morphologically motivated soft-skeleton. The aforementioned soft-skeletonization enables us to use clDice as a fully differentiable, real-valued, optimizable measure. The Algorithm 2 describes its implementation. We refer to this as the soft-clDice.</p><p>For a single connected foreground component and in the absence of knots, the homotopy type is specified by the number of linked loops. Hence, if the reference and the predicted volumes are not homotopy equivalent, they do not have pairwise linked loops. To include these missing loops or exclude the extra loops, one has to add or discard deformation retracted skeleta of the solid foreground. This implies adding new correctly predicted voxels. In contrast to other volumetric losses such as Dice, cross-entropy, etc., clDice only considers the deformation-retracted graphs of the solid foreground structure. Thus, we claim that clDice requires the least amount of new correctly predicted voxels to guarantee the homotopy equivalence. Along these lines, Dice or cross-entropy can only guarantee homotopy equivalence if every single voxel is segmented correctly. On the other hand, clDice can guarantee homotopy equivalence for a broader combinations of connected-voxels. Intuitively, this is a very much desirable property as it makes clDice robust towards outliers and noisy segmentation labels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Cost Function</head><p>Since our objective here is to preserve topology while achieving accurate segmentations, and not to learn skeleta, we combine our proposed soft-clDice with soft-Dice in the following manner:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L c =(1 α)(1 softDice) + α(1 softclDice) (3)</formula><p>where α 2 [0, 0.5]. In stark contrast to previous works, where segmentation and centerline prediction has been learned jointly as multi-task learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>, we are not interested in learning the centerline. We are interested in learning a topology-preserving segmentation. Therefore, we restrict our experimental choice of alpha to α 2 [0, 0.5].</p><p>We test clDice on two state-of-the-art network architectures: i) a 2D and 3D U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, and ii) a 2D and 3D fully connected networks (FCN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. As baselines, we use the same architectures trained using soft-Dice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Adaption for Highly Imbalanced Data</head><p>Our theory (Section 3), describes a two-class problem where clDice should be computed on both the foreground and the background channels. In our experiments, we show that for complex and highly imbalanced dataset it is sufficient to calculate the clDice loss on the underrepresented foreground class. We attribute this to the distinct properties of tubularness, sparsity of foreground and the lack of cavities (Betti number 2) in our data. An intuitive interpretation how these assumptions are valid in terms of digital topology can be found in the supplementary material.</p></div>

We conclude that α can be interpreted as a hyper parameter which can be tuned per-dataset. Intuitively, increasing the α improves the clDice measure for most experiments. Most often, clDice is high or highest when the graph and topology based measures are high or highest, particularly the β 1 Error, Streetmover distance and Opt-J F1 score; quantitatively indicating that topological properties are indeed represented in the clDice measure.</p><p>In spite of not optimizing for a high soft-clDice on the background class, all of our networks converge to superior segmentation results. This not only reinforces our assumptions on dataset-specific necessary conditions but also validates the practical applicability of our loss. Our findings hold for the different network architectures, for 2D or 3D, and for tubular or curvilinear structures, strongly indicating its generalizability to analogous binary segmentation tasks.</p><p>Observe that CREMI and the synthetic vessel dataset (see Supplementary material) appear to have the smallest increase in scores over the baseline. We attribute this to them being the least complex datasets in the collection, with CREMI having an almost uniform thickness of radii and the synthetic data having a high signal-to-noise ratio and insignificant illumination variation. More importantly, we observe larger improvements for all measures in case of the more complex Vessap and Roads data see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>. In direct comparison to performance measures reported in two recent publications by Hu et al. and Mosinska et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, we find that our approach is on par or better in terms of Accuracy and Betti Error for the Roads and CREMI dataset. It is important to note that we used a smaller subset of training data for the Road dataset compared to both while using the same test set.</p><p>Hu et al. reported a Betti error for the DRIVE data, which exceeds ours; however, it is important to consider that their approach explicitly minimizes the mismatch of the persistence diagram, which has significantly higher computational complexity during training, see the section below. We find that our proposed loss performs superior to the baseline in almost every scenario. The improvement appears to be pronounced when evaluating the highly relevant graph and topology based measures, including the recently Qualitative: In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, typical results for our datasets are depicted. Our networks trained on the proposed loss term recover connections, which were false negatives when trained with the soft-Dice loss. These missed connections appear to be particularly frequent in the complex road and DRIVE dataset. For the CREMI dataset, we observe these situations less frequently, which is in line with the very high quantitative scores on the CREMI data. Interestingly, in the real 3D vessel dataset, the soft-Dice loss oversegments vessels, leading to false positive connections. This is not the case when using our proposed loss function, which we attribute to its topology-preserving nature. Additional qualitative results can be inspected in the supplementary.</p><p>Computational Efficiency: Naturally, inference times of CNNs with the same architecture but different training losses are identical. However, during training, our soft-skeleton algorithm requires O(kn 2 ) complexity for an n ⇥ n 2D image where k is the number of iterations. As a comparison, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> needs O(c 2 mlog(m)) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>) complexity to compute the 1d persistent homology where d is the number of points with zero gradients in the prediction and m is the number of simplices. Roughly, c is proportional to n 2 , and m is of O(n 2 ) for a 2D Euclidean grid. Thus, the worst complexity of <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is O(n 6 log(n)).</p><p>Additionally, their approach requires an O(clog(c)) complexity to find an optimal matching of the birth-death pairs. We note that the total run-time overhead for soft-clDice compared to soft-Dice is marginal, i.e., for batch-size of 4 and 1024x1024 image resolution, the former takes 1.35s while the latter takes 1.24s on average (&lt;10% increase) on an RTX-8000.</p><p>Future Work: Although our proposed soft-skeleton approximation works well in practice, a better differentiable skeletonization can only improve performance, which we reserve for future research. Any such skeletonization can be readily plugged into our approach. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental multi-class studies would sensibly extend our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusive Remarks</head><p>We introduce clDice, a novel topology-preserving similarity measure for tubular structure segmentation. Importantly, we present a theoretical guarantee that clDice enforces topology preservation up to homotopy equivalence. Next, we use a differentiable version of the clDice, soft-clDice, in a loss function, to train state-of-the-art 2D and 3D neural networks. We use clDice to benchmark segmentation quality from a topology-preserving perspective along with multiple volumetric, topological, and graph-based measures. We find that training on soft-clDice leads to segmentations with more accurate connectivity information, better graph-similarity, better Euler characteristics, and improved Dice and Accuracy. Our soft-clDice is computationally efficient and can be readily deployed to any other deep learning-based segmentation tasks such as neuron segmentation in biomedical imaging, crack detection in industrial quality control, or remote sensing. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
