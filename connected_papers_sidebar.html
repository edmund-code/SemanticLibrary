While many have been developed for complex tasks such as disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse datasets, their readiness for seemingly simpler tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (for example, the kidney), remains unclear. This study answers two questions: How good are current cell foundation models? and How can we improve them? We curated a multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species dataset sampled from 2542 kidney whole slide images. Three state-of-the-art cell foundation models\u2014Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT\u2014were evaluated. To enhance performance, we developed a human-in-the-loop strategy that distilled multi-model predictions, improving data quality while reducing reliance on pixel-level annotation. Fine-tuning was performed using the enriched datasets, and segmentation performance was quantitatively assessed. Here we show that cell nuclei segmentation in kidney pathology still requires improvement with more organ-targeted foundation models. Among the evaluated models, CellViT achieves the highest baseline performance, with an F1 score of 0.78. Fine-tuning with enriched data improves all three models, with StarDist achieving the highest F1 score of 0.82. The combination of the foundation model-generated pseudo-labels and a subset of pathologist-corrected \u201chard\u201d patches yields consistent performance gains across all models.

We used TissueNet to train Mesmer, a deep-learning-enabled segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated that Mesmer is more accurate than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance.

FastReseg introduces a novel algorithm that refines inaccuracies in existing image-based segmentations using transcriptomic data, without radically redefining cell boundaries. By combining image-based information with 3D transcriptomic precision, FastReseg enhances segmentation accuracy. Its key innovation, a transcript scoring system based on log-likelihood ratios, facilitates the quick identification and correction of spatial doublets caused by cell proximity or overlap in 2D. FastReseg reduces circularity in boundary derivation, and addresses computational challenges with a modular workflow designed for large datasets. The algorithm\u0027s modularity allows for seamless optimization and integration of advancements in segmentation technology. FastReseg provides a scalable, efficient solution to improve the quality and interpretability of ST data, ensuring compatibility with evolving segmentation methods and enabling more accurate biological insights. Accurate cell segmentation is foundational in spatial transcriptomics, as it delineates individual cells and assigns transcript molecules to their cellular origins, influencing all subsequent analyses. Segmentation errors can contaminate single-cell expression profiles with neighboring cell transcripts, introducing spatially dependent bias that confounds analyses. For instance, differential expression analyses of a given cell type across spatial domains may be skewed by errors that arise from poorly segmented cells, overshadowing genuine biological signals 1 . Most spatial transcriptomics studies (Fig. 1A) employ image-based cell segmentation, which involves immunofluorescence (IF) staining of cellular morphological markers like the nucleus and membrane to identify cell boundaries. Classical methods like the watershed algorithm 2 and nucleus expansion have been largely superseded by more advanced deep-learning techniques such as Cellpose 3 and Mesmer 4 . However, limitations in image quality of real-world tissue samples (Fig. 1B) -such as weak staining, ambiguous boundaries, or poor 3D resolution-can lead to segmentation inaccuracies that propagate downstream. Transcript-based methods offer an alternative by segmenting regions of distinct local expression profiles 5,6 . But they can face difficulties at the borders of closely related cell types or in low-transcript-density regions, limiting their usage in many cell-driven biological studies. Baysor 7 , JSTA 8 and Proseg 9 represent a new class of hybrid approach which combine transcript data with image priors. However, in practice the image priors are usually limited to the nuclear segmentation results, and the transcriptomic data frequently dominates the final segmentation outcome. This strong dependence on transcript data risks introducing circularity to analyses, with the gene expression patterns we wish to study influencing how the single cell expression matrix is defined in the first place. Moreover, the existing hybrid methods often require substantial computational resources 7-10 due to the volume of transcript data and sophisticated modeling involved, and thus struggle to generate satisfactory cell-level segmentation for densely packed tissue samples. To address these challenges, we introduce FastReseg, an R package designed to enhance the precision of cell segmentation by leveraging transcriptomic data to correct and refine initial image-based segmentation results. FastReseg processes spatial transcriptomic datasets, along with their initial cell assignment provided by image-based cell segmentation, through a three-tiered modular approach: it first assesses cells for potential segmentation inaccuracies, then identifies misassigned transcript groups within those likely erroneous cells, and finally reassigns these mislocated transcripts to their appropriate cellular origins. This stepwise progression allows users the flexibility to halt the process after any stage to examine intermediate results, adapting the workflow to suit specific research needs at various analytical depths.

However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization of treatment plans. Segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which involves identifying and delineating regions of interest (ROI) in various medical images, such as organs, lesions, and tissues 1 . Accurate segmentation is essential for many clinical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression 2,3 . Manual segmentation has long been the gold standard for delineating anatomical structures and pathological regions, but this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often requires a high degree of expertise. Semi-or fully automatic segmentation methods can significantly reduce the time and labor required, increase consistency, and enable the analysis of large-scale datasets 4 . Deep learning-based models have shown great promise in medical image segmentation due to their ability to learn intricate image features and deliver accurate segmentation results across a diverse range of tasks, from segmenting specific anatomical structures to identifying pathological regions 5 . However, a significant limitation of many current medical image segmentation models is their task-specific nature. These models are typically designed and trained for a specific segmentation task, and their performance can degrade significantly when applied to new tasks or different types of imaging data 6 . This lack of generality poses a substantial obstacle to the wider application of these models in clinical practice. In contrast, recent advances in the field of natural image segmentation have witnessed the emergence of segmentation foundation models, such as segment anything model (SAM) 7 and Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal prompts all at once 8 , showcasing remarkable versatility and performance across various segmentation tasks. There is a growing demand for universal models in medical image segmentation: models that can be trained once and then applied to a wide range of segmentation tasks. Such models would not only exhibit heightened versatility in terms of model capacity but also potentially lead to more consistent results across different tasks. However, the applicability of the segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM 7 ) to medical image segmentation remains limited due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Essentially, SAM is a promptable segmentation method that requires points or bounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets. This resembles conventional interactive segmentation methods 4,9-11 but SAM has better generalization ability, while existing deep learning-based interactive segmentation methods focus mainly on limited tasks and image modalities. Many studies have applied the out-of-the-box SAM models to typical medical image segmentation tasks [12][13][14][15][16][17] and other challenging scenarios [18][19][20][21] .

One such model is Segment Anything (SAM), which is designed for image segmentation tasks. However, as with other foundation models, our experimental findings suggest that SAM may fail or perform poorly in certain segmentation tasks, such as shadow detection and camouflaged object detection (concealed object detection). This study first paves the way for applying the large pre-trained image segmentation model SAM to these downstream tasks, even in situations where SAM performs poorly. Rather than finetuning the SAM network, we propose SAM-Adapter, which incorporates domain-specific information or visual prompts into the segmentation network by using simple yet effective adapters. By integrating task-specific knowledge with general knowledge learnt by the large model, SAM-Adapter can significantly elevate the performance of SAM in challenging tasks as shown in extensive experiments. We can even outperform task-specific network models and achieve stateof-the-art performance in the task we tested: camouflaged object detection, shadow detection. Our code of adapting SAM in downstream applications have been released publicly at https://github.com/tianrun-chen/SAM-Adapter-PyTorch/ and has benefited many researchers.

But automatic tubular structure segmentation in CT scans is a challenging problem, due to issues such as poor contrast, noise and complicated background. A tubular structure usually has a cylinder-like shape which can be well represented by its skeleton and cross-sectional radii (scales). Inspired by this, we propose a geometryaware tubular structure segmentation method, Deep Distance Transform (DDT), which combines intuitions from the classical distance transform for skeletonization and modern deep segmentation networks. DDT first learns a multitask network to predict a segmentation mask for a tubular structure and a distance map. Each value in the map represents the distance from each tubular structure voxel to the tubular structure surface. Then the segmentation mask is refined by leveraging the shape prior reconstructed from the distance map. We apply our DDT on six medical image datasets. Results show that (1) DDT can boost tubular structure segmentation performance significantly (e.g., over 13% DSC improvement for pancreatic duct segmentation), and (2) DDT additionally provides a geometrical measurement for a tubular structure, which is important for clinical diagnosis (e.g., the cross-sectional scale of a pancreatic duct can be an indicator for pancreatic cancer). * This work was done when Xu Wei and Jieneng Chen were at JHU. \u2020 Equal Contribution.", "custom_author": "Yan Wang, \u2020 Xu, Fengze Liu, Jieneng Chen, Yuyin Zhou, Wei Shen, Elliot Fishman, Alan Yuille", "custom_title": "Deep Distance Transform for Tubular Structure Segmentation in CT Scans", "custom_year": "N/A", "font": {"color": "#343434"}, "id": 9, "label": "Deep Distance Transform for", "shape": "dot", "size": 75}, {"color": "#4d8d8c", "custom_abstract": "Artificial intelligence has revolutionized computational biology. Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology. However, current computational models focus on either omics or image analysis, lacking their integration. To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual-omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into \u0027sentences\u0027 by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image-transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness. Computational biology has advanced notably with artificial intelligence (AI) for tasks such as gene expression enhancement, single-cell perturbation prediction, tissue annotation, diagnosis, primary tumor origin predictions and image retrieval from hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E)-stained images [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] . Recently, foundation models like CLIP 8 , CoCa 9 and DeCLIP 10 have been adapted to the field, fine-tuned with pathology images and captions, as seen in PLIP and CONCH 11,12 . These visual-language foundation models support applications like text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval, histology image classification, captioning and diagnosis improvement. Omics data, including transcriptomics and genetics, provide crucial insights into cell types in health and disease, enhancing our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, lineage tracing and disease mechanisms [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] . Combining omics data with histology images offers complementary information for both research and clinical applications, and has been used for predicting cancer outcomes, prognosis and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 3 . However, existing methods remain task specific and lack a unified multimodal AI model to integrate histology and omics data. Additionally, challenges remain in developing infrastructure to efficiently analyze sequencing data and pathology images together.

We introduce a novel similarity measure termed center-lineDice (short clDice), which is calculated on the intersection of the segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleta. We theoretically prove that clDice guarantees topology preservation up to homotopy equivalence for binary 2D and 3D segmentation.

Existing adaptations of SAM primarily focus on general object segmentation and lack specialized design for CSS tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose the Universal Curvilinear structure Segmentation (UCS) model, which adapts SAM to CSS tasks while further enhancing its cross-domain generalization. UCS features a novel encoder architecture integrating a pretrained SAM encoder with two innovations: a Sparse Adapter, strategically inserted to inherit the pre-trained SAM encoder\u0027s generalization capability while minimizing the number of fine-tuning parameters, and a Prompt Generation module, which leverages Fast Fourier Transform with a high-pass filter to generate curve-specific prompts. Furthermore, the UCS incorporates a mask decoder that eliminates reliance on manual interaction through a dual-compression module: a Hierarchical Feature Compression module, which aggregates the outputs of the sampled encoder to enhance detail preservation, and a Guidance Feature Compression module, which extracts and compresses image-driven guidance features. Evaluated on a comprehensive multi-domain dataset, including an in-house dataset covering eight natural curvilinear structures, UCS demonstrates state-ofthe-art generalization and open-set segmentation performance across medical, engineering, natural, and plant imagery, establishing a new benchmark for universal CSS.
